# Instructions for the Staff of the Math Help Center

1. Log in to the Math Help Center Piazza forum at [https://piazza.com/buffalo/spring2020/mthhelp](https://piazza.com/buffalo/spring2020/mthhelp)

2. Click on the post "Welcome to UB Math Help Center!" which is pinned to the top of the list of posts. Check the links to zoom meetings at the top of this post. If you see a link to a meeting which is about to end, try to join this meeting. If this works, talk to the host of the meeting and ask him or her to make you the new host, so you can continue the meeting. If you cannot join such meeting, create your own new zoom meeting.

3. Edit the "Welcome to UB Math Help Center!" post to enter information about your zoom  meeting. If you took over an existing meeting as a host, the link to the meeting will stay the same, just insert your name and your Help Center hours. If you created a new zoom meeting, you need to enter the link to the meeting as well. The format of this information should be as follows:

    ```
    Zoom meeting with John Smith 11:00 AM-12:00 PM:
    https://buffalo.zoom/my/smith12343?pwd=V0tzVEw2c0Z6elBmOXNUUVprOEt
    ```
    Make sure not to delete the information about the other  zoom meeting and the image with instructions for students.

4. Students seeking help will post their questions on the Math Help Center Piazza. Questions which has been already answered should have a green label "An instructor thinks this is a good note/question". Look for the earliest post for the given day which does not have this label (the newest posts are at the top of the list, so scroll down). Check the author of the post, and ask in the zoom meeting if the student is present (you can also check if his/her name is on the list of meeting participants). When two zoom meetings are run in parallel, the student can be in the other meeting. If the student is not in your meeting, move on to the next unlabeled (i.e. unanswered) question posted on Piazza. When you get to a student who is present, click on the "good note" button on his/her post on Piazza to indicate that the student is getting help.

5. Once you are finished helping one student, follow the same procedure to select the next one.

6. At the end of your Math Help Center hours, pass hosting of the zoom meeting to the next person on duty - provided that he/she gets in touch with you on zoom. If this does not happen, let all students who are in your meeting and have not been helped yet know that your meeting is ending, and that they need to join a meeting with a different Help Center staff member.
End the meeting and remove your name and the meeting link from the "Welcome to UB Math Help Center!" Piazza post.



**Note.**
